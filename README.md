Stream

Automatization script for the PeerStreamer
======

To run this script, you need to install the PeerStreamer before. You can download it following the instructions in the following link: http://peerstreamer.org/content/download

To run the script, you need to provide the video filename, the interface where the video is streamed through, and the channel's name. The script will generate the channels.conf file which can be given to your friends or whoever you want so they can watch your streaming. Just run:

	./stream.sh vide_filename interface channel_name
	
You can also set the port with the -p option.
